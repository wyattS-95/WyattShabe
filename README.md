# Wyatt Shabe
## Welcome to My GitHub Repository!
This repository showcases the coding projects I have completed and am currently working on. As a software engineering student, I am continually searching for new challenges to learn new skills and improve the ones I already possess. This collection represents my exploration of computer science and software engineering. It shows what I have learned and demonstrates my problem-solving skills.

## Projects
Here's a brief overview of my favorite projects found in this repository:

### A.I.B.B.: 
This project involved building a machine learning pipeline using XGBoost and scikit-learn to predict the finishing position of a Formula 1 driver in a race based on historical performance, track characteristics, and driver-specific factors. This project demonstrates experience with real-world data challenges, such as missing values, categorical encoding, and handling domain-specific nuances.

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, scikit-learn, and Google Colab

### Weather App with AI Assistant: 
This project combines a weather forecast application with an AI assistant, providing both weather information and interactive chatbot capabilities. This project demonstrates the ability to work with external APIs as well as focus on both functionality and user experience.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Botpress Webchat, OpenWeatherMap API, and Botpress Cloud

### Arbitration Calculator: 
This project involved creating a betting arbitration calculator that determines the ideal stake amounts to bet on a favored and underdog prop. By analyzing the odds and calculating payouts, it ensures a profit regardless of the outcome, leveraging discrepancies in betting odds to create an "arbitrage opportunity." This project demonstrates the ability to address practical problems in the sports betting or financial domain, where arbitrage opportunities are present.

Technologies used: C++, g++, VSCode

### AI-Driven Hedge Fund Prototype: 
This project is a prototype for an AI-driven hedge fund that integrates fundamental and factor-based investing strategies. It uses machine learning models (XGBoost, mocked LightGBM) and NLP (BERT via Hugging Face API) to analyze stock financials, earnings sentiment, and quantitative factors like momentum and volatility. A hybrid decision engine with reinforcement learning optimizes portfolio weights, demonstrating a scalable approach to automated trading. This project highlights skills in financial modeling, API integration, and AI system design.

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, scikit-learn, cvxpy, yfinance, requests, matplotlib, HuggingFace

### Mini GPT: 
This project is a minimal implementation of a GPT-like transformer model built from scratch using PyTorch. This project is designed to run efficiently on a CPU with limited memory. Mini GPT processes word-level text data to predict the next word in a sequence and generate coherent text based on a given prompt. It does this by using a single transformer block with multi-head self-attention, making it lightweight yet powerful enough to learn patterns in small datasets. This project showcases my ability to implement complex machine learning architectures, understand transformer models, and optimize for resource-constrained environments.

Technologies used: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, tqdm

### Sensor Fusion for Drone Tracking:
This project implements a Kalman Filter to fuse noisy radar and infrared sensor data for tracking a droneâ€™s 2D trajectory, enhancing situational awareness in a simulated Air Force ISR scenario. It generates synthetic sensor data, applies data fusion to estimate accurate positions, and visualizes results to demonstrate improved tracking accuracy. This project showcases skills in sensor fusion, data processing, and visualization, aligning with defense applications like battlespace awareness and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).

**Technologies used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, FilterPy
