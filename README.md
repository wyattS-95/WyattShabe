# Wyatt Shabe
## Welcome to My GitHub Repository!
This repository showcases the coding projects I have completed. As a software engineering student, I am continually searching for new challenges to learn new skills and improve the ones I already possess. This collection represents my exploration of computer science and software engineering. It shows what I have learned and demonstrates my problem-solving skills.

## Projects
Here's a brief overview of my favorite projects found in this repository:

### A.I.B.B.: This project involved building a machine learning pipeline using XGBoost and scikit-learn to predict the finishing position of a Formula 1 driver in a race based on historical performance, track characteristics, and driver-specific factors. This project demonstrates experience with real-world data challenges, such as missing values, categorical encoding, and handling domain-specific nuances.

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost, scikit-learn, and Google Colab

### Weather App: Brief description of the project and its significance.

Technologies used: List of languages, frameworks, and tools utilized.  
Link to the project folder or relevant files.

### Arbitration Calculator: This project involved creating a betting arbitration calculator that determines the ideal stake amounts to bet on a favored and underdog prop. By analyzing the odds and calculating payouts, it ensures a profit regardless of the outcome, leveraging discrepancies in betting odds to create an "arbitrage opportunity." This project demonstrates the ability to address practical problems in the sports betting or financial domain, where arbitrage opportunities are present

Technologies used: C++, g++, VSCode
